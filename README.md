# MoA_Metaanalysis-of-inheritance
project repo for a meta-analysis of inheritance patterns across the tree of life

> As a rule, hybrids do not represent the form exactly intermediate between the parental strains...Those traits that pass into hybrid association entirely or almost entirely unchanged, thus themselves representing the traits of the hybrid, are termed dominating, and those that become latent in the association, recessive.
-Gregor Mendel (1865)

Despite Mendel's assertion of widespread non-additive inheritance, in reality we haven't a clue whether this is true! I think it would be worthwhile to know, quantitatively, what hybrids look like, and whether there are any differences between clades/trait-types in inheritance patterns. More soon!
